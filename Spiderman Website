      <p class="page-description">From when the character of Spider-Man was first presented to the public in 1962, he has become a houshold name that we adore. Spider-Man made his debut in the comic titled "Amazing Fantasy." He was created by someone that all of us superhero lovers know, Stan Lee,
        and also Steve Ditko. This first ever glimps of Spider-Man introduced a kid named Peter Parker who lives with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. Peter has a bad run-in with a radioactive spider and this is how he becomes Spider-Man. The comic goes into the story about how he takes on the responsibility
        of being a hero after the death of his Uncle Ben.

      <p class= "page-description"> Over the years, we have seen a variety of different actors play Spider-Man. One of the most memorable Spider-Man movies on the silver screen that started the giant platform was made by Sony Pictures. The superhero was played by an actor named Tobey Maguire who took Peter Parker,
        Spider-Man's alter ego, and gave him more character dynamics while also staying true to our hero. The second actor to portray Spider-Man was Andrew Garfield who introduced the Amazing Spider-Man series with new villians and a new love interest that we did not have in the previous series.
        There is one more Spider-Man, the most recent, Tom Holland, and he has changed the face of Spider-Man and the way that we see the character in his movies. After Marvel took over the Spider-Man universe and added him into the MCU, his character has been changing in different ways."</p>

        <p class="page-description"> Tom Holland is our newest Spider-Man that we have seen. His character has worked hand-in-hand with another MCU character named Tony Stark, played by Robert Downy Jr., who takes him under his wing and tries to teach him the ropes of becoming a superhero while also having a normal life.
          In the story, he wants to just be your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. He is already different because he looks a lot younger than the pervious actors who have played Spider-Man, so he can be characterized more as a teenager. Another great thing about the newer Spider-Man's produced by Marvel, is that there is a genuine struggle with the line said by dear Uncle Ben in
            first Spider-Man with Tobey Maguire, "With great power, comes great responsibility." This is something that I had been missing from the pervious movies. As a huge fan myself, I wanted to see more of that internal struggle with the character. This was given to me in the Tom Holland Spider-Man character. The newest
            movie that was just released on December 17th, 2021 brought back some of our favorite villians and.....ALL THREE SPIDER-MEN!!! This was a HUGE deal for MCU fans. The three heros worked together to save the world, yet again, and in the end, we see our newest Spider-Man face the most difficult task of all...but I
            won't spoil that for you. GO WATCH IT!!!"</p>
